# Integrative-Programming-for-Statisticians-in-cross-functional-teams
The repository focuses on collaboration and communication strategies using cloud based infrastructure e.g Azure/AWS, integrative cost-efficient tech stacks e.g, R, Python and Power BI in comparison to, SAS and SAS JMP with sponsor/CRO dedicated platforms e.g, Eli Lilly's MagnoIAI and Cytel's East Horizon. In order to provide improved project timelines and cost-savings. Statisticians role from end to end will be explored across Phase 1 to Phase 3. Regulatory restrictions restrictions are neglible for example, FDA review and submission requirements, as FDA guidance documents are updated these requirements will be updated, but, standardised statistical analysis frameworks e.g. ICH E9 and CDISC will be upheld.
